<h3>The convex hull calculator can also work with files.<br />
The format of the file should be as follows - on every row you have the X and the Y coordinates of the points delimited by a space.

<p>For example :<br />
<em>100 100<br />
250 200<br />
178 249</em></p>

<p>The rows, where not valid coordinates are written, will be ignored.<br />
After you put some points to the canvas, you can save your progress in a file. Afterwards the file could be opened and saved again. There are no limitations to the file extension used by the calculator.<br />
When a file is opened, the coordinates from the file would be read and drawn to the canvas. The convex hull and the angle hull will be again computed in real time automatically.<br />
All file operations could be found under the <em>&#39;File&#39;</em> menu.<br />
There is also the option <em>&#39;New&#39;</em> which will clear all the points that are drawn on the canvas.</p>
