<h3>This is a simple convex and angle hull calculator. &nbsp;<br />

<br/>
Angle hull from all points on the canvas with angle alpha is a circular path where the angle between the left and the right tangent of the convex hull is the same and is equal to alpha. The angle hull is computed for the following values of alpha - 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 150 grads.</h3>
