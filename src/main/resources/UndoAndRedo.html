<h2><strong>Undo and redo :</strong></h2>

<h3>Every addition, deletion or movement of a point, can be undone or redone. The both menus are not available when there is no action that could be undone or redone. When a point is moved, only it start and end positions are considered. For example, when you move a point from position A to position B, when you undo the change, the point will go back to position A. When multiple points are generated, they are considered as a one action. This means when you undo such a generation, all of this points will be removed from the canvas. Undo and redo does not work for saved files.</h3>
