<h3>If you want to test the convex hull calculator, you can also use the <em>&#39;Random points&#39;</em> feature. In the menu <em>&#39;Options&#39;</em> you can find the option<em> &#39;Create random points&#39;</em>. There are five amount of points that could be created - 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000. After one of them is chosen, the chosen amount of points would be drawn. If there are any other points already drawn, the random ones will be added to them. The addition of points with the random generator is considered as one action, so Undo will remove all the generated points and Redo will add all of them back to the canvas. If we assume that the canvas is divided in 9 equal rectangles, then the random points will be drawn in the middle one, so that the angle hull can be seen easier.</h3>
